## Project Objective

To leverage business analytics and data visualization in uncovering customer behavior, seasonality trends, and operational insights in the hospitality industry, enabling **data-driven decisions for pricing, inventory, and customer satisfaction improvements.**

---

## Dataset

### Source

A hotel booking dataset with **119,390 records** including:

- Booking details (dates, lead time, ADR)
- Market segment, customer type, country
- Room type, deposit type, cancellation
- Meal type, special requests, stay length

---

## Dataset Cleaning

Performed using **Excel** and **SAS Viya**:
- Converted 3-letter country codes to 2-letter codes for SAS mapping.
- Removed outliers in ADR (>198) and lead time (>354).
- Transformed numeric to categorical for dashboard filtering.
- Removed duplicates and corrected inconsistencies for analysis readiness.

## Visualization & Analysis

### Power BI Dashboards

- **Product Analysis Dashboard:** Shows hotel type distribution, peak months, room popularity, and geo-distribution of bookings.
- **Customer Analysis Dashboard:** Visualizes customer types, market segments, and ADR trends over years.
- **Customer Behavior Dashboard:** Analyzes cancellations, booking changes, and retention rates across segments.
- **Hospitality Dashboard:** Examines ADR by deposit type, meal preferences, lead time correlation, and monthly booking trends.

### Python Descriptive Statistics

- Used `.describe()` to calculate **mean ADR (101.8)** and **mean lead time (104 days)**.
- Established baselines for dashboards and insight generation.

---

## Key Insights

- **Global Distribution:** City hotels are globally spread (Angola, Canada, Brazil, Russia, China, Australia), while resorts are Europe-focused, with **Portugal as the busiest location**.
- **Seasonality:** Peak waiting list months are April, May, January (City Hotels), and October, December (Resorts).
- **Room Preference:** **Room Type A** dominates city hotel bookings, **Room Type E** is most popular in resorts.
- **Customer Trends:** Sharp increase in transient customers and online bookings, showing a shift towards flexibility and convenience.
- **Retention:** Corporate customers have the highest repeat rates (**27.8%**), while online bookings show low retention (**1.09%**).
- **Pricing Patterns:** ADR decreases as lead time increases; "No deposit" bookings yield the highest ADR.
- **Cancellation Risks:** Contract customers, especially under group segments, exhibit the highest cancellation rates.

## Recommendations

> ðŸ“Œ This section is separated to guide decision-making without exposing direct charts.

- **Optimize Inventory:** Increase availability of high-demand rooms (e.g., Room Type A).
- **Boost Off-Season Occupancy:** Offer discounts, loyalty programs, and promotions during low seasons.
- **Improve Booking Experience:** Build a responsive, intuitive online booking system for rising transient and online customers.
- **Recover Lost Segments:** Tailor marketing to contract and group customers, collaborating with agencies to regain this segment.
- **Dynamic Pricing:** Use AI-powered models to adjust ADR based on demand and seasonality, improving financial performance.
- **Enhance Service Quality:** Train staff for handling booking changes efficiently, ensuring smooth guest experiences and loyalty.

---

## Future Work

- Deploy **predictive models** for cancellation and ADR forecasting using regression and ensemble methods.
- Integrate **real-time booking data** into dashboards for operational insights.
- Conduct **feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning** for improved model accuracy.
- Expand into **revenue forecasting** and dynamic pricing simulations for management teams.
