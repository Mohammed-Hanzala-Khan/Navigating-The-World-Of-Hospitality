# Hospitality Insights

### ADR vs Deposit Type
Analysis showed that bookings with ‘no deposit’ had the highest Average Daily Rate (ADR), followed by non-refundable and refundable options. This suggests that guests are willing to pay more for hassle-free bookings without upfront deposits, highlighting a preference for flexibility and convenience.

### Peak Season Patterns
Booking trends confirmed that June and September are peak months, aligning with school holidays and vacation periods. This insight supports seasonal pricing and promotional strategies to maximize occupancy and revenue.

### Lead Time Impact
There is an inverse relationship between lead time and ADR, indicating that guests who book further in advance tend to secure lower rates. This emphasizes the importance of dynamic pricing and early-bird promotions to optimize revenue.

### Guest Dining Preferences
Breakfast-inclusive packages were the most preferred meal option, followed by Half Board (typically breakfast and dinner) and Self Catering. This insight can guide meal package offerings to match guest expectations and boost dining revenue.
