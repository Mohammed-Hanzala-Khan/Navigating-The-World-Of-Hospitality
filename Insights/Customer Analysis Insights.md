# Custoemr Analysis Insights

### Rising Transient Customers
Analysis showed a clear upward trend in transient customers, with a 26.5% increase (2015–2016) and 5.4% increase (2016–2017). This reflects a customer shift toward flexible, personalized reservation preferences over traditional booking methods.

### Growth in Online Bookings
Online booking emerged as a rapidly growing segment, with a 21.5% increase (2015–2016) and 6.5% growth (2016–2017). This highlights the growing customer demand for seamless, convenient online reservation systems.

### Decline in Contract and Group Bookings
Despite overall growth, contract bookings fell from 11.8% (2015) to 1.8% (2017), and group bookings dropped from 0.9% to 0.6% in the same period. This signals potential revenue risks if group and contract customer segments are not actively re-engaged.

### Average Daily Rate (ADR) Trends
ADR increased notably from 2015 to 2016 but saw a slight decline in 2017, aligning with reduced contract and group bookings and suggesting the need for dynamic pricing strategies to maintain revenue stability.
